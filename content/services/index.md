The pharmaceutical industry is strictly regulated by governmental bodies such as the FDA, EMEA and IGZ. The most important rules have been recorded in the GMP (good manufacturing practices) guidelines.

Every pharmaceutical production company needs to ensure that they have a validation programme for all critical facilities, installations and equipment involved in the production process. In validation we prove that the procedure, process, device, material, activity or system does indeed do what it is supposed to do. This is a time-consuming exercise that requires a multildisciplinary approach. In addition, excellent organisation and documentation are needed to maintain an overview of responsibilities and activities.
