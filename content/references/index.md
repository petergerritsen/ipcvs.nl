"The performance of Ren&eacute; met or exceeded expectations. His tasks were completed on time and of high quality and quantity. Ren&eacute; has a lot of knowledge, takes responsibilties, pro-actively delivers support, sets priorities, is results-driven, flexible, a team player, has a positive attitude, a calm appearance and structurally keeps others updated."   
_Marjolein Broekhuisen, Supervisor BTO CoE Cell Culture, Centocor_

"Ren&eacute; has been a valuable resource, demonstrating to possess a well founded knowledge in the field of validation with regards to regulatory requirements as well as 'industry practice'. Furthermore Ren&eacute; has shown to take the initiative when required and ability to perform the required activities indepedently without close supervision. This has especially been demonstrated in the new facilitiy project where Ren&eacute; performed a lead role."   
_Frank van der Steen, Validation Manager, Synco Biopartners_   
_Paul Ives, Director of Operations, Synco Biopartners_

"During the ten months that Ren&eacute; worked as a contractor at Centocor I closely worked with him on a number of projects. Ren&eacute;'s capacity to quickly understand an issue, find his way through the organisation independently and come up with a well thought-through, practical and complete solution is a real trait. In addition, Ren&eacute; is a pleasant and friendly colleague whom I would fully recommend to anyone interested in hiring him."   
_Diana van der Graaf-Harris, Senior Engineer Cell Culture, Centocor_
